# 42-NorminetteNvim
This plugin allows to show the norminette errors inside your buffer, through diagnostics and it's compatible with quickfixlist!
It only works for `.c` and `.h` files.

## Dependecies

- [Neovim >= 0.10](https://neovim.io/)
- [Norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette)
- [Plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) for async.
- [mini.icons](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.icons) for toggle icon.

## Usage

You can activate the toggle two ways : `:Norminette` or using the `<leader>n`, notice that you can change the keybind to your liking.

By default the plugin is running on a asynchronous process to prevent slowdowns. But if you find the constant errors popping up or notice a slowdown, try to disable it.

Tip: To open a split with the quickfix list you can use a functionality of neovim and assign it to a keybind like
```
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>q", vim.diagnostic.setloclist, { desc = "Open diagnostic [Q]uickfix list" })
```
This way you only need to press `<leader>q` and the split opens automatically.
